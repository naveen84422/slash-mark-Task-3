# MNIST Digit Classification

## Project Overview
This project implements **handwritten digit classification** using the **MNIST dataset**, a benchmark dataset in deep learning. The model is trained using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify digits from **0 to 9** with high accuracy.

## Features
- **Dataset Preprocessing:** Normalization, reshaping, and one-hot encoding.
- **Deep Learning Model:** CNN architecture using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- **Training & Evaluation:** Performance metrics like accuracy and loss analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Displaying sample images and model performance graphs.
- **Model Deployment:** Saving the trained model for inference.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Deep Learning** (TensorFlow, Keras)
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-digit-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd mnist-digit-classification
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
- The **MNIST dataset** contains **60,000 training** and **10,000 testing** images of handwritten digits.
- Each image is **28x28 pixels in grayscale**.
- The dataset is automatically loaded using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Usage
1. **Train the Model**: Run the training script to train the CNN model.
2. **Evaluate Performance**: Check accuracy, loss, and predictions.
3. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to classify handwritten digits.

To train the model, run:
```sh
python train.py
```

## Results
- Achieves **high accuracy** on the MNIST dataset.
- Model correctly classifies most handwritten digits.
- Loss and accuracy graphs show stable training.

## Future Improvements
- Implementing **Transfer Learning** for better generalization.
- Deploying the model as a **web app** using Flask/Django.
- Extending to real-world handwriting datasets.
